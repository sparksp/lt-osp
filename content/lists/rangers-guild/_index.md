From the start of the Spring Moot 2020 the Archers Guild will be renamed to the Rangers Guild. This process is expected to be fully complete in a year or less with a gradual replacement of old Lammies and Loresheets being the main place where the Archers name is used.

This does not mean that your card or item is invalid, instead the terms Archers and Rangers will be interchangeable in regard to game mechanics and effects (such as Oathsworn Archers still working with an item that requires Oathsworn Rangers) for at least 2020.
