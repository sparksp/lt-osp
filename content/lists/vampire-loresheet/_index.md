Vampires are Unliving (see [Unliving Loresheet]({{< ref "/lists/unliving-loresheet" >}})) and are subject to all of the rules on that sheet.

Vampires are considerably more powerful during the evening. Some Vampire Powers and Skills are marked with a (V) and may only be used between Dusk (8pm) and Time-out (1am). Between Time-in (usually 10am) and Dusk (8pm), all Vampires have a Base Dismiss level of 10.

This Loresheet allows you to purchase the following Skills (at a main event - you may not prebook these Skills) as listed in the Occupational Skill section of the main handbook. All of these Skills when purchased will appear immediately on your character card. You do not require a training voucher for these Skills and the OSP cost for a Skill may differ in cost from the options available via other routes or as different creatures.
