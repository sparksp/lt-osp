Werecreatures automatically gain the OS [Beast-form intelligence]({{< ref "/skill/beast-form-intelligence" >}}) and may speak whilst in Beast-form normally.

Some Werecreature Powers and Skills are marked with a (B) and may only be used in Beast-form.

This Loresheet allows you to purchase the following Skills (at a main event - you may not prebook these Skills) as listed in the Occupational Skill section of the main handbook. All of these Skills when purchased will appear immediately on your character card. You do not require a training voucher for these Skills and the OSP cost for a Skill may differ in cost from the options available via other routes or as different creatures.
