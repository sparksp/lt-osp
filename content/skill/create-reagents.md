This skill allows the character to create one alchemical reagent at each Lorien Trust Main Event using ingredients from the Alchemists Guild. These reagents will expire at the end of the event and can be used to improve and aid the creation of both Alchemical and Weaponsmithing items. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities.
