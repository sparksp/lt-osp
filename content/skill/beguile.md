This skill replaces the [Detect and Remove Beguile][detect-and-remove-beguile] Occupational Skill. The character has the ability to detect and remove the Beguile effect. To detect if an individual is under the influence of a Beguile, the character must engage them in meaningful conversation for at least 30 seconds, after which they may make the call “detect beguile”. To remove a Beguile it must be detected as above, the character must then continue the conversation for another thirty seconds. At the end of this period all effects of the Beguile are removed. This ability requires concentration. The character also may use 4 spell Power to create an innate Beguile effect after 5 minutes of meaningful two-way conversation with their intended target. This effect cannot be countered and the OOC call is “innate beguile”. Note: this is an effect and not a spell and may not be combined with Spell Reduction.
