The character gains access to the level 3 of any list they can cast to level 2 (for example if the character has Level 2 Healing they will now be able to cast Level 3 Healing. If they have Level 2 Dark Incantation and Necromancy they would be able to cast the Level 3 spell of Dark Incantation and Necromancy). This ability will only grant level 3 spells to be cast â€“ if the character has a level 2 and a level 1 casting ability it will only grant level 3 access for the level 2 skill. This does not grant them any additional Spell Power.
