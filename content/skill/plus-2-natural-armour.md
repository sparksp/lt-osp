This replaces the skill [+1 Magical Armour][plus-1-natural-armour] and grants the wearer 2 points of Magical Armour; this does stack with ‘Mage Armour’ and ‘Paladins Armour’ but not with any other powers or effects. This armour may only be repaired by tearing 1 power card to restore a location to full hits.
