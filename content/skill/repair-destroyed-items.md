This skill replaces [Weaponsmith (Apprentice)]({{< ref "weaponsmith-apprentice" >}}) and allows the character to make a level 1 melee weapon or a level 1 shield at each Lorien Trust Main Event (1 item total per event). This skill also allows one reforge (a process of heating and quenching) that allow more powerful, complex or desirable items â€“ the character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create. In addition this skill allows the character to repair a crafted weapon or shield that has been destroyed. This repair requires a minimum of 1 minute of appropriate roleplayed action.
