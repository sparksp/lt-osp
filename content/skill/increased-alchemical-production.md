This skill replaces the [Create Reagents (Improved)][create-reagents-improved] Occupational Skill. Any crafted Potion, Poison or Antidote created with the characters own occupational skills count as being created with reagents. The character will not create reagents that can be traded, given away or otherwise used by any other character – instead their skill in Alchemy mimics the requirement for their use.
