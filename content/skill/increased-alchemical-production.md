This skill replaces [Create Reagents (Improved)]({{< ref "create-reagents-improved" >}}). Any crafted [Potion]({{< ref "create-potion-novice" >}}), [Poison]({{< ref "create-poison-novice" >}}) or [Antidote]({{< ref "create-antidotes" >}}) created with the characters own occupational skills count as being created with reagents. The character will not create reagents that can be traded, given away or otherwise used by any other character â€“ instead their skill in Alchemy mimics the requirement for their use.
