This skill replaces [Strikedown Shot]({{< ref "strikedown-shot" >}}) and allows a character to choose to strike for the Halt or Strikedown effects with ammunition from a projectile weapon. This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect and will replace the normal Through call of an arrow or bolt.
