This skill replaces the [Immune to Charms][immune-to-charms] Occupational Skill. The character is immune to all charm effects (Befriend, Beguile, Enthral and Enthral Unliving). The character may also change the effects Befriend, Enthral or Enthral Unliving into mass effects, if they are capable of casting them. This requires 4 power to cast as a level 3 spell effect. The enhanced spell counts in all ways as a mass spell and therefore cannot be countered. The vocals for the spell are “By the High power of True Song I mass Befriend you all/Enthral you all/Enthral Unliving”. Note: this effect may not be combined with Spell Reduction (regardless of source).
