This skill replaces the [Immune to Charms OS][immune-to-charms]. The character is immune to all charm effects. Charms are a sub group of Mind effects and include Befriend, Beguile, Distract and Enthral.
The character may also change the effects Befriend, Enthral or Distract into mass effects, if they are capable of casting them. This requires them to tear a total of 4 spell cards to cast as a level 3 spell effect. The enhanced spell counts in all ways as a mass spell and therefore cannot be countered. The vocals for the spell are “By the *High* power of True Song *I mass Befriend/Enthral/Distract you all*.”. Note: this effect may not be combined with Spell Reduction, or be used with the [Scribe Scroll OS][scribe-scroll].
