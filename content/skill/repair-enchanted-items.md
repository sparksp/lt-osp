This skill replaces the skill [Armoursmith (Apprentice)][armoursmith-apprentice] and allows the character to make a level 1 suit of armour or a level 1 shield at each Lorien Trust Main Event (1 item total per event). This skill also allows one reforge (a process of heating and quenching) that allow more powerful, complex or desirable items – the character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create. In addition this skill allows the character to repair magical and non-magical shields that have been destroyed. This repair requires a minimum of 30 seconds appropriate roleplayed action. A character with this skill may also remove a Corrosion effect from an armour location with 30 seconds of appropriate roleplay.
