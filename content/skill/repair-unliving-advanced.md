This skill replaces [Revitalise Unliving]({{< ref "revitalise-unliving" >}}) and allows a character to extend a Chant of Repair Unliving to affect every location on a single character, without requiring extra Spell Power. The repair is location by location, not simultaneous and the Corruptor may choose what damage to repair first. Proximity distance with any part of the target is sufficient and the spell functions in all other ways as normal. In addition the character may expend one power and concentrate on a target within proximity distance, after 10 seconds they may remove the debilitation effect.
