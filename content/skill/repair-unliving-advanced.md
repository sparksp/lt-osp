This skill replaces the [Revitalise Unliving][revitalise-unliving] Occupational Skill and allows a character to extend a Chant of Repair Unliving to affect every location on a single character, without requiring extra Spell Power. The repair is location by location, not simultaneous and the Corruptor may choose what damage to repair first. Contact with any part of the target is sufficient and the spell functions in all other ways as normal.
