This skill allows a character to translate one named script to the common script for every time the skill is purchased. Each of the most common scripts are listed below and fall into one to three Script families: Regional and Historical, People and Race, Myth and Magic. A loresheet for each script can be collected from Game Control once this skill is on the character card. Some TNS scripts are not listed below and are not part of the Script Categories – these TNS Scripts are only available with particular prerequisites or Loresheets.

**NOTE: Only a character with a TNS Skill may attempt to translate a language in this way. Any attempt to translate the script using a “Hard Skill” (i.e. using a process of deduction or by utilising out-of-character knowledge or devices) will be breaking the Spirit of the Rules and Cheating.**
