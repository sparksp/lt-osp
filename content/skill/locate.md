With this skill a character can do a more thorough and quicker search of an individual using the searching rules. A character using the Locate skill reduces the time required for performing an in-character search to 30 seconds. In addition, items concealed using the [Conceal Item][conceal-item] Occupational Skill must be revealed to the person using the Locate skill in addition to the normal search.
