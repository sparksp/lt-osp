Claws count as small melee weapons for the purpose of delivering effects, venoms (may not be used with any Magical Venom) or weapon oils (max 30 mins duration – any effect that would normally last longer will expire after 30 mins). If the creature also has the [Retractable Claws]({{< ref "retractable-claws" >}}) occupational skill – the claws may not be retracted whilst any of the spells, effects venoms or weapon oils are applied and active.
