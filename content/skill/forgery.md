This skill replaces [Written Forgery]({{< ref "written-forgery" >}}). A character with this skill is able to create forged items (excluding weapons, armour and shields) with appropriate additional skills. The character must be in the relevant Guild to use this skill and may create a single forged item per Lorien Trust Main Event. Forged crafted items (such as a Forged Potion) require an appropriate [Create Skill]({{< ref "search" >}}?q=^create) and will consume a make slot from your event allocation of the appropriate level. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities.

In addition a character with this skill is able to create in-character forged documents. Once per event a character with the Forgery skill may create paperwork that allows access to training facilities, magical books or other resources that normally allow training. Both the Forging Character and Training Character must visit Game Control at the same time to complete the out-of-character function of the Forgery skill (this is in addition to any in-character roleplay). The Forgery allows a two Tier 1, 2 or 3 skills or a single Tier 4 skill (including restricted skills) from any Guild to be accessed. The skill will be added to the character card immediately. Guild permission is not required (or recommended) for the use of this training forgery.
