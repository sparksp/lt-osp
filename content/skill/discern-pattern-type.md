This skill gives a character the ability to determine the type of the target's pattern (Living, Unliving, or Magical). This requires the character to place their hand approx. 1ft of the character and concentrate for 10 seconds and make the call "discern pattern type". This does not allow the detection of alien or aberrant patterns.
