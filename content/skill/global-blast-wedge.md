Requires the [Magebolt Wedge OS][magebolt-wedge] and applicable lammie or loresheet. The character may enter a wedge with other Warlocks, and the head of the wedge may use 4 spell cards from the wedge to cast a Blast spell as a Global effect. Excess cards are wasted. This counts as a level 3 ranged spell. The head of the wedge must have this OS, all members must be able to cast Blast and the wedge must be at least two characters. The vocals for the spell are "*By the High power of magic â€™I strike you Global Blast.*"
