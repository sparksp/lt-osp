This character has the ability to evaluate the quality of materials that a crafted item may contain that can be salvaged, or its resale value via alternative (often criminal) channels. If a crafted item with over 2 years of remaining duration is examined - this character can offer up to a quarter of its original base crafting value (maximum). These items are often taken through a process of Disenchantment (shaving off magically active parts or ingredients to use for other purposes) and sold on at a reduced rate (still working to full effect and duration) via Black-Market contacts. If these items are then presented to a character with a Fence skill for a second time â€“ they will be able to determine its poorer state and are unlikely to make an offer. Rare or unusual items may be examined but are often rejected as their quality or uniqueness make them difficult to sell on.
