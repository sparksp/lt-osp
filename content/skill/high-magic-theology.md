This skill replaces [Theology]({{< ref "theology" >}}). The character may cast spells from the Theology list (including the third level spells which usually require the [High Magic]({{< ref "high-magic-x" >}}) Occupational Skill). If they also have the Ritual Magic Character Skill or the Contribute Character Skill they will gain a bonus when contributing to summoning or creating an Ancestral in a Ritual.
