A character with this skill can, after 10 seconds of concentration at a range of up to 30 feet (~9m), make the call “discern level of elemental being or possession” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. If the target examined is an elemental being or has an elemental possession, they should tell the discerner the dismiss level. The target will not be aware in- character that they have been discerned. Some Elemental creatures may be shielded from this effect and may be able to locate the direction or even the character Discerning, see [Shield Dismiss Level]({{< ref "shield-dismiss-level" >}}) Occupational Skill.
