This skill replaces the [Create Poison (Master)][create-poison-master] Occupational Skill and allows the character to make a level 1, a level 2 and a level 3 poison at each Lorien Trust Main Event plus one Magical poison per event with ingredients that can be obtained and used in the Alchemists Guild. Once per year a character with the Create Poison (Magical) Occupational Skill can use their Magical Poison skill for a single event to create a single Tailored Magical Poison. Details of levels and costs of materials can be gained in-character at the Alchemists Guild.

_Note: The term Magical used for this skill refers to the level of expertise, as many of the lower level poisons can also be magical in nature._
