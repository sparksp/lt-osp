An Awakened creature is a type of Special Creature that is an evolution of a Base Race (Dwarf for example). These creatures still remain linked to their Base Race for the purposes of items and effects that can target them (Dwarf Bane etc.) and for detection/discern purposes. To become an Awakened, a Awakened Creature of the correct type must perform a Rite of Creation to align your pattern and unlock your potential. Once this rite is complete you will receive an appropriate Awakened Loresheet which details any Race Specific Abilities or Rules as well as Occupational skills that are not normally available or can be purchased at a discount. Becoming an Awakened Creature prevents the character becoming an Essence Creature, Summonable Creature or any other kind of Special Creature (Generally created in a Ritual). _Loresheets_ for this skill are available for download and print from The Lorien Trust Website. Awakening will count as one of your four skill buys for the year but will only replace the Race description on the front of your character card.
