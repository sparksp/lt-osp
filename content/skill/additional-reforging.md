This allows more powerful, complex or desirable items to be made. The character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create. See [Armoursmith][armoursmith] and [Weaponsmith][weaponsmith] occupational skill entries for more details. If the character has both the Armoursmith and Weaponsmith occupational skill – they will gain an additional reforge for each.
