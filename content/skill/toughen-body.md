Any Normal damage taken by the character has the damage effect Subdue, in addition to any other damage effects it might have. This additional Subdue effect functions in the same way as the Ritual of Peace when determining any effect clashes. E.g. Normal Crush would reduce the location to zero. This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.
