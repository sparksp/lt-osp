This skill replaces the [Create Potion (Master)][create-potion-master] Occupational Skill and allows the character to make a level 1, a level 2 and a level 3 potion at each Lorien Trust Main Event plus one Magical potion per event with ingredients that can be obtained and used in the Alchemists Guild. Once per year a character with the Create Potion (Magical) Occupational Skill can use their Magical Potion skill for a single event to create a single Tailored Magical Potion. Details of levels and costs of materials can be gained In-character at the Alchemists Guild.

_Note: The term Magical used for this skill refers to the level of expertise, as many of the lower level potions can also be magical in nature. If a Potion has a PR of 1 or more it is considered Magical for the purposes of Lammies, Loresheets and Special Creatures._
