The character may enter a wedge with other Warlocks, and the head of the wedge may use 4 spell cards from the wedge to cast a Blast spell as a level 3 mass spell. Excess cards are wasted. This counts in all way as a mass spell and cannot be countered. The head of the wedge must have this OS, all members must be able to cast Blast and the wedge must be at least two characters. The vocals for the spell are "*By the High power of magic I strike all around me Mass Blast \<location>.*" This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.
