A character with this skill can, after 10 seconds of concentration at a range of up to 30 feet (~9m), make the call “discern level of Daemonic being or possession” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. If the target examined is a Daemonic being or has a Daemonic possession, they should tell the discerner the dismiss level. The target will not be aware in- character that they have been discerned. Some Daemonic creatures may be shielded from this effect and may be able to locate the direction or even the character Discerning, see [Shield Dismiss Level]({{< ref "shield-dismiss-level" >}}) Occupational Skill.
