This skill allows the character to make a level 1 suit of armour or a level 1 shield at each Lorien Trust Main Event (1 item total per event). In addition, this skill also allows one reforge (a process of heating and quenching) that allows more powerful, complex or desirable items to be made. The character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create.
