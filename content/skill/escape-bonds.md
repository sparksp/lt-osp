This skill allows the character to escape from any in-character bonds or restraints. This takes 1 minute of concentration and the character must not be Immobilised. This skill does not allow a character to escape from a locked room or other such prisons. In the interests of OOC safety, IC bonds or restraints **must be role-played** and not actually applied.
