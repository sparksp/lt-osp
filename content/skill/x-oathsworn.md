The character has sworn a binding oath to support the Faction or Guild \<X>. This Occupational Skill can be only be gained with permission from the relevant Faction or Guild and they may remove it at any time. This skill may only be purchased mid-season and does not count towards your 4 skills permitted per year. If the skill is removed by a Faction or Guild it will be deactivated from your list of character Occupational Skill skills and removed from your card when next reprinted. The skill will remain dormant until the Guild or Faction allows the character to oathswear again, at this point the skill will be reactivated with no OSPs needing to be spent.
