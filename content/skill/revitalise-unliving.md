This skill allows a character to extend a Repair Unliving to every location on a single character, for no additional Spell Power. The repair is location by location, not simultaneous and the Corruptor may choose what damage to repair first. Contact with any part of the target is sufficient but the Chant of Repair Unliving cannot repair any location with a mortal wound, these must be repaired separately. The spell functions in all other ways as normal.
