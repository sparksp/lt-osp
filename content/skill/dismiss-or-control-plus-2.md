This skill allows the character to add 2 to the total of any Dismiss or Control they cast, including casting as part of a wedge. Note: A Wedge must consist of at least 3 contributing characters â€“ all casting the same Dismiss or Control affect (I.e. Control Elemental) and may include both normal and High Casting versions of the same spell.
