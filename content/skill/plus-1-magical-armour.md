This grants the character 1 point of Magical Armour on every location. If this armour becomes damaged then any character with their own power can repair it using a single Spell Power, to restore fully the protection value of the armour on a single location by holding the open palm of their casting hand towards the target (approx. 1ft away from it), and speaking the vocals "By my power I replenish this armour". If the character gains a Mage or Paladins Armour it will instead boost that High Sigil effect by 1 point and will follow all of the rules for that High Sigil effect. You may never have more than 4 points of Magical Armour by any means. +1 Magical Armour will refresh at time-in.
