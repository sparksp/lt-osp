This skill allows the character to access and utilise the Tree Network (a form of Transport Network that spans Erdreja in a similar way to the Transport Circle Network). This skill is not available to a character with an Unliving pattern or the CS Corruption. _Loresheets_ for this skill are available for download and print from The Lorien Trust Website.
