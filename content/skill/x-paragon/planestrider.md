### The Veil (Abilities and Powers)

- **Ironpattern** - The Planestrider gains +16 Dismiss (replaces [+10 Dismiss]({{< ref "skill/plus-10-dismiss-rank" >}} "+10 Dismiss Rank")). If dismissed the creatures grace period will be 10min (instead of 1min).
- **Shrouded Dismiss** (Replaces [Shielded Dismiss]({{< ref "shield-dismiss-level" >}} "Shield Dismiss Level")) - Any attempt to discern the dismiss level of this creature will fail (respond with "No effect"). The creature may then immediately cast a single innate confusion against the character attempting to discern the Dismiss level (this cost no power and does not require a casting skill).
- **Enchanted Fury** - The Planestrider may strike for Enchanted with any weapon that they can use (including with both weapons using Ambidexterity)
