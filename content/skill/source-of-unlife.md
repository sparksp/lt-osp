This skill replaces the [Repair Unliving (Advanced)][repair-unliving-advanced] Occupational Skill and includes the [Mind Healing][mind-healing] Occupational Skill. It also allows the character to cast the Total Repair Unliving Spell without having the requirement of the [High Magic][high-magic] Occupational Skill. If the character gains the [High Magic (Corruption)][high-magic-corruption] Occupational Skill, they gain Spell Reduction (3) for the spell Total Repair Unliving.
