This skill replaces [Repair Unliving (Advanced)]({{< ref "repair-unliving-advanced" >}}) and includes the [Repair Unliving (Advanced)]({{< ref "repair-unliving-advanced" >}}) and [Mind Healing]({{< ref "mind-healing" >}}) Occupational Skills. It also allows the character to cast the Total Repair Unliving Spell without having the requirement of the [High Magic]({{< ref "high-magic-x" >}}) Occupational Skill. If the character gains the [High Magic (Corruption)]({{< ref "high-magic-x" >}}) Occupational Skill, they gain Spell Reduction (3) for the spell Total Repair Unliving.
