A character with this skill may apply and use weapon oils on their own melee, projectile or thrown weapons without the Poison Lore CS. This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect and it will not grant access to the Poison Loresheet. Requires concentration to use and follows the same rules as applying a Venom to a melee weapon in the Poison Lore Character skill (3 seconds minimum concentration). See the entry for Weapon Oils in the Potion and Poison section of the Rulebook.
