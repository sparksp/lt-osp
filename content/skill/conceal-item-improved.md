This skill replaces the [Conceal Item][conceal-item] Occupational Skill. You may conceal a pouch containing a maximum of 50 coins (Copper, Stell, Gold or Taal). This concealed pouch cannot be found by searching unless the searcher has the [Locate][locate] Occupational Skill. The coins must remain in the pouch to count as concealed. You may use Conceal Item (Improved) to conceal a single object (as per the [Conceal Item][conceal-item] occupational skill) instead of hiding coins but not at the same time. Items will remain concealed even after character death. To use your Conceal Item (Improved) Occupational Skill you must obtain a conceal lammie from Game Control, which will have your Character name and Player ID written on it before the lammie is sealed. To conceal a pouch requires concentration and will take 10 seconds - once the item is concealed, concentration is not required. You should attach your conceal lammie to the pouch and hide it within your character kit. When a concealed item is removed from its hidden place (by choice or through searching) the conceal lammie should be removed and retained to either re-attach using the rules above or for concealing a different item. NOTE: If you have an item that is concealed that is Magical (has a PR Rating) if Detect Magic is cast on you the Detect Magic will work but will not allow the item to be found.
