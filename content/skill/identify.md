A character with this skill can identify the approximate powers or purpose of a magical lammed item (excluding weapons, armour, scrolls and alchemical items) - these may include structures, standing stones or other unusual items. The examination of the item requires a minimum of 1 minute appropriate role-play with a Referee or Marshall present and will not always produce a result.
