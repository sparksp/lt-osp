This skill replaces and includes [Immune to Through]({{< ref "immune-to-through" >}}). The character and their armour are immune to the Through effect, unless it has the Artefact or appropriate Elemental Weakness damage type. This grants the character Damage Reduction (Harm & Mage Bolt). This Skill will not alter any other damage effect that ignores armour. Provides no protection against Retribution.
