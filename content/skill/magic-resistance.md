This skill replaces [Immune to Through][immune-to-through]. This grants the character Damage Reduction (Harm & Magebolt). The character will take only a single point of Enchanted damage that will ignore armour from either Magebolt or Harm (this does not prevent Magebolt or Harm from breaching the Ritual of Peace). The character and their armour are also immune to the Through effect, unless it has the Artefact damage type. This OS will not alter any other damage effect that ignores armour. It provides no protection against Retribution.
