This skill replaces the skill [Armoursmith (Artisan)][armoursmith-artisan] and allows the character to make a level 1, level 2 and level 3 suit of armour or level 1, level 2 and level 3 shield at each Lorien Trust Main Event (3 items in total per event). In addition, this skill also allows three reforges (a process of heating and quenching) that allows more powerful, complex or desirable items to be made. The character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create. In addition this skill allows the character to repair crafted and magical shields that have been destroyed. This repair requires a minimum of 1 minute appropriate roleplayed action and is reduced to a minimum of 30 seconds if the character also has the CS Shield Use. A character with this skill may also remove a Corrosion effect from an armour location with 30 seconds of appropriate roleplay.
