This skill replaces [Through]({{< ref "through" >}}) and allows a character to strike for the Through effect with thrown weapons thrown from their primary hand (requires thrown weapon CS), or with melee blows from any weapon that the character has the ability to use (including weapons used with the ambidexterity CS). This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect.
