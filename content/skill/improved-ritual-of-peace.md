This skill only functions if the character does not have any Tier 5 Occupational Skill and is in an area covered by a Ritual of Peace. This skill prevents the character from being taken below 0 hits by any of Artefact (including Bane and Affect), Mage Bolt, Harm, Fatal effects; instead they are left at 0 Hits. This does not stop the pattern corrupting effect of Fatal.
