This skill requires and replaces the [Toughen Body]({{< ref "toughen-body" >}}) Occupational Skill. Any Normal or Enchanted damage type (including Elemental Weakness versions) taken by the character has the damage effect Subdue, in addition to any other damage effects it might have. This additional Subdue effect functions in the same way as the Ritual of Peace when determining any effect clashes. E.g. Harm is Enchanted, but breaches the RoP so is unaffected by Harden Bodyâ€™s Subdual effect. This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.
