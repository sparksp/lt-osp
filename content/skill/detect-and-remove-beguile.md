This skill gives a character the ability to detect and remove the Beguile effect on another character. To detect if an individual is under the influence of a Beguile, the character must engage them in meaningful conversation for at least 30 seconds, after which they may make the call "detect beguile". To remove a Beguile it must be detected as above, the character must then continue the conversation for another thirty seconds. At the end of this period all effects of the Beguile are removed. This ability requires concentration.
