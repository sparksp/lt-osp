The character is automatically affected by the Lay to Rest Incantation upon death. In addition if the character with the Dedicated Follower gains a Paladin Armour High Sigil it will confer an AV of 3 on all locations instead of 2 (but will follow all of the standard rules for the spell including the maximum AV of 4 for an Armour Type).
