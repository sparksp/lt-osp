**A Paragon is a creature that has attained, skill, knowledge, power (or a combination of all three) beyond that of traditional study.**

- Only one Paragon Skill may be attained by a character
- A Paragon Skill may replace and/or include Character Skills, Powers, Abilities or Occupational Skills (these will be explicitly mentioned below).
- Paragon Skills do not affect or change the Race or Pattern of the Creature and may be attained by any Special Creature, Essence Creature or Awakened Creature as long as the Paragon Skill does not explicitly exclude a category or creature type.
- Some Paragon Skills require explicit Character Skills, Occupational Skills or Pattern Types to gain. In addition, if a skill or occupational skill (excluding those that are included or replaced by the Paragon Skill) is removed from the creature, the associated Paragon Skill will be lost.

### Greater than the Sum

A Paragon Skill is a mystical alignment or convergence of skills or powers that form into a sum greater than the parts. Because of this a Paragon Skill may not be detected or discerned by any spell, power or effect (although some unusual abilities may be noticeable in-character).

### Further Notes

- Once your character has become a Paragon it may not be changed or removed under normal circumstances.
