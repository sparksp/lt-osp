This skill will replace the [Dismiss/Control +6][dismiss-or-control-plus-6] Occupational Skill and allows the character to add 8 to the power of any dismiss or control they cast, including casting as part of a wedge. Note: A Wedge must consist of at least 3 contributing characters - casting the same Dismiss or Control affect (I.e. Control Elemental) and may include both normal and High Casting versions of the same spell.
