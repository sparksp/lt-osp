This skill replaces [Mighty Blow]({{< ref "mighty-blow" >}}). This skill allows a character to strike for the Crush or Strikedown effects with a well role-played blow with a large melee weapon held in two hands. The character is also immune to the Strikedown and Repel effects. This skill may not be purchased by anyone with the skill [Goblin Resilience]({{< ref "goblin-resilience" >}}) and prevents the purchase of Goblin Resilience.
