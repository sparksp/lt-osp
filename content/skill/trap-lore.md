Trap Lore allows the character to make a single Trap Bag at each Lorien Trust Main Event with materials that can be obtained and then used to craft items in the Scouts Guild. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. In addition the character with the Trap Lore skill can also perform the following actions:

 * Once per 10 mins the character may check an area or object for a trap. The target area must be no greater than a 1ft Square space or an object such as a door, box, handle, or other suspicious object. The character requires concentration and hold a free hand approx. 1ft from the target for 30 seconds. If a trap is detected it may be disarmed safely with a further 30 seconds of appropriate roleplay. This action requires the presence of a Referee or Marshall.

 * A character with Trap Lore may set a Trap with a Crafted Trap Bag. This action will consume the materials of the Trap Bag itself and will transfer the effect of the Trap Bag to the trapped object or area for 10 mins. This action requires the presence of a Referee or Marshall.
