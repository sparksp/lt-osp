This skill replaces [Discern Pattern Type]({{< ref "discern-pattern-type" >}}). The character may place a hand approx. 1ft from the target and concentrate for 10 seconds to discern their pattern type (Living, Unliving, or Magical), if they are an Alien or Aberrant pattern and if they are under the effects of a possession. They will not be able to detect the rank of the possession. If a referee or marshal is present they may add additional information. A character with the Advanced Pattern skill will also be able to detect if a character is Regenerating damage but will not be able to detect the rate at which they are regenerating. Advanced pattern scan may also allow the detection and understanding of the cures required for some Curses.
