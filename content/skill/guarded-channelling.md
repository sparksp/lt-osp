A Channeler with this skill may add to any non-instant Cure spell (in the Cure Category) to the vocal **“and also claim an aura of defence”**. They will then be under an Aura of Defence while casting the non-instant Cure spell. The Aura of Defence effect will end as soon as the location(s) being cured are fully cured.
