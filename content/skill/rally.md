This skill replaces the [Immune to Fear][immune-to-fear] Occupational Skill and the character is immune to the Fear effect. Additionally, the character gains the ability to cast the spell Rally using their own power. If the character already has the ability to cast the spell, they will gain Spell Reduction (3) for the Rally Spell. Alternatively, If the character has no spellcasting character skills or have expended all of their \[power\] for the day, they may instead cast the Rally spell (for no power cost) once per 10 min. Once you have used this ability you cannot use it again for 10 mins.
