The character affected recovers lost wounds at a faster rate – one hit per location is recovered every time period. If one or more “effect(s)” are specified then only wounds that could normally be recovered using those effects can be regenerated. If no “effect(s)” are specified then any wound that could be normally recovered using the “Cure Wound” or “Heal Wound” effects can be regenerated. If any “exclusion(s)” are specified then the damage type or effect specified always counts as Artefact damage to the affected character, and they cannot regenerate Artefact damage.
