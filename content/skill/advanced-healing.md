This skill replaces [Revive]({{< ref "revive" >}}) and allows a character to extend a Chant of Heal Wound to affect every location on a single character, without requiring extra spell Power. The healing is location by location, not simultaneous and the healer may choose what damage to heal first. In addition the character may expend one power and concentrate on a target within proximity distance, after 10 seconds they may remove the debilitation effect.
