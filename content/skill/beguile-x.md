Each level of this skill requires and replaces the previous level. Once a day per level of the Occupational Skill (Item cards or Power req.), the character may create the Beguile effect after 5 minutes of meaningful two-way conversation with their intended target. This effect cannot be countered and the OOC call is “innate beguile”. This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.

Note: this is an effect and not a spell, and may not be combined with Spell Reduction.


## Vampire Loresheet

**Note:** This Skill may only be used between Dusk (8pm) and Time-out (1am).
