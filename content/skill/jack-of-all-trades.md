This skill may only be learned once at a time. This skill counts as a training voucher (of any tier) for a single OS purchased from an OS list in chapter 2 which is marked with Ω, as long as the character is oathsworn to that Guild[^1]. To use this skill they must be accompanied to Game Control by someone with command of the Guild they wish to train from (in order to confirm that all roleplay requirements for training have been met).

Using this skill will remove it from the character’s card and free it up to be purchased again the following Event Season.

[^1]: This does not include any other skills or lists that may be associated with that Guild.

For example a character with [Mages Oathsworn][oathsworn] would be able to purchase the following Tier 5 skills [Ritualist (Master)][ritualist-master], [Diagnose Powers][diagnose-powers] and [Cast Additional Magecraft][cast-additional-magecraft]. They would not be able to purchase [High Magic (Spellcasting)][high-magic] or [+16 Spell Cards][plus-16-spell-cards].
