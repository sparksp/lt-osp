This skill may only be learned once at a time. This skill counts as a training facility (of any tier) for a single Occupational Skill purchased from an Occupational Skill list which is marked with Ω, as long as the character is [Oathsworn]({{< ref "x-oathsworn" >}}) to that Guild[^*].

To use this skill they must be accompanied to Game Control by someone with [Command]({{< ref "x-command" >}}) of the Guild they wish to train from (in order to confirm that all roleplay requirements for training have been met). Using this skill will remove it from the character’s card and free it up to be purchased again the following Event Season.

[^*]: This does include any other skills or lists that may be associated with that Guild ([Arcane]({{< ref "/lists/arcane-guilds/" >}} "Arcane Guilds"), [Knowledge]({{< ref "/lists/knowledge-guilds/" >}} "Knowledge Guilds") or [Martial]({{< ref "/lists/martial-guilds/" >}} "Martial Guilds") – as long as Oathsworn to an Appropriate Guild). It is not possible to use Jack of All Trades for the Tier 5 Occupational Skill [High Magic \<X>]({{< ref "high-magic-x" >}}).
