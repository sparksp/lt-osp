A character with this skill may extend the Discerning Wounds vocal to include the detection of mind effects. This detection effect requires a minimum of 10 seconds whilst holding a hand in proximity range of the target and using the vocals **"Discern Wound, Poison, Pattern Effect, Dismiss, Disease or Mind Effect"**. The character with this skill may also add to a Chant of Heal Wound or Chant of Repair Unliving Spell with the additional vocal **"and also remove any Mind Effects from your pattern"**. If this spell (and additional vocal) is maintained for a minimum of 30 seconds the character will remove all Mind effects from the target. Using this ability requires concentration. In addition the character with this Occupational Skill also has the [Immune to Sleep]({{< ref "immune-to-sleep" >}}) Occupational Skill.
