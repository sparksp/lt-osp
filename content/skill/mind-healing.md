This skill gives a character the ability to detect and remove all Mind effects. To detect if an individual is under the influence of any Mind effect, the character must engage them in sensible conversation for at least 30 seconds, after which they may make the call “discern mind effect”. To remove a discerned Mind effect, the character must continue the conversation for at least a further minute. At the end of this period the Mind effect is removed. Using this ability requires concentration.
