A character with this skill may extend the Discerning Wounds vocal to include the detection of mind effects. This detection effect requires a minimum of 10 seconds whilst holding a hand in proximity range of the target and using the vocals **"Discern Wound, Poison, Pattern Effect, Disease or Mind Effect"**. The character with this skill may also add to any non-instant Cure spell (in the Cure Category) with the the additional vocal **"and also remove any Mind Effects from your pattern"**. If this spell (and additional vocal) is maintained for a minimum of 30 seconds the character will remove all Mind effects from the target. Using this ability requires concentration. In addition the character is immune to the Sleep effect.
