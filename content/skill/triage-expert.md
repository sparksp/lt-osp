This skill replaces [Triage (Master)]({{< ref "triage-master" >}}) and reduces the time required for each Triage (Advanced) activity to 30 seconds rather than 1 minute to a Living Pattern. In addition the character may use the Triage (Expert) to repair damage to an Alien or Magical Pattern using the standard Triage (Advanced) Character skill rules (1 min per location). This skill will have no effect when used with Triage (Advanced) for raising LHV above 0 (zero).
