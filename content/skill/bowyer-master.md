This skill replaces [Bowyer (Apprentice)]({{< ref "bowyer-apprentice" >}}) and allows the character to make a Crafting Level 1 and Level 2 Projectile Weapon or Bandolier at each Lorien Trust Main Event with tools that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild area. Alternatively the Bowyer (Master) may combine the Level 1 and Level 2 Crafting to make a Level 3 Projectile Weapon. This skill allows you to decrease the time required for checking that retrieved or returned projectiles are safe to use again. A Bowyer (Master) may check up to 12 projectiles per min (5 Seconds per projectile). In addition this skill allows you to Mend a Shattered Bow or crossbow with 30 seconds of appropriate roleplay, this ability does not require any power and may not be used to Mend any other item.
