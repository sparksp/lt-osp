A character with this skill is able to create in-character forged documents. Once per event a character with the Written Forgery skill may create paperwork that allows access to training facilities, magical books or other resources that normally allow training. Both the Forging Character and Training Character must visit Game Control at the same time to complete the out-of-character function of the Written Forgery skill (this is in addition to any in-character roleplay). The Written Forgery that the skill creates, allows a single Tier 1, 2 or 3 skill (including restricted skills) from any Guild to be accessed. The skill will be added to the character card immediately. Guild permission is not required (or recommended) for the use of this training forgery.
