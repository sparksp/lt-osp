A character with Surgeon is able to repair extreme damage done to a character with a Living pattern such as scars, broken bones and lost limbs. To use this skill the Surgeon must inflict a mortal wound (subject to the Ritual of Peace) on the damaged location using a small weapon and spend a total of 1 minute of roleplay action. After this minute a referee or marshal will inform if the extreme damage has been repaired but the location will still be suffering from the mortal wound.
