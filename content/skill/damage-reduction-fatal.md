This grants the character Damage Reduction (Fatal). Note: Fatal will still ignore armour and put the character into its grace period and no damage to the location can be cured until the Fatal effect is removed. However, the target location no longer automatically suffers a mortal wound but takes one point of Artefact damage ignoring armour instead.
