Grants the character Damage Reduction (Fatal) and changes the Fatal Damage effect to the following:
* Fatal only affects Living patterns
* The Fatal default damage type is Enchanted unless preceded by an Elemental Weakness or Artefact
(e.g. Earth Fatal will ignore the Damage Reduction to Fatal)
* Ignores all armour
* Places the Target into their Grace Period
* Prevents healing (and Regeneration) from affecting the Target until the Fatal Wound is Removed
