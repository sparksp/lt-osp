This increases the AV of any armour worn by +2, subject to the rule of double. The character and any armour worn are immune to the Crush effect, unless it has the Artefact damage type. This skill does not stop Crush from destroying a shield. This Occupational Skill will not alter any other damage effect that ignores armour.
