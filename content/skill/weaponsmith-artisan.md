This skill replaces [Repair Destroyed Items]({{< ref "repair-destroyed-items" >}}) and allows the character to make a level 1 and level 2 melee weapon or level 1 and level 2 shield at each Lorien Trust Main Event (2 items in total per event). This skill also allows two reforges (a process of heating and quenching) that allow more powerful, complex or desirable items â€“ the character may only use these reforge abilities on an item that they are creating themselves and some items may require more than one reforge to create. In addition this skill allows the character to repair crafted weapons and shields that has been destroyed. This repair requires a minimum of 1 minute appropriate roleplayed action and is reduced to 30 seconds for a shield if the character also has the CS Shield Use.
