This skill allows a character to choose to strike for Enchanted with any melee weapon in their primary hand or a large melee weapon held in both hands, unless the weapon already does a damage type other than normal (e.g. silver/natural). This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.
