This skill allows the character to make a Crafting Level 1 Projectile Weapon or Bandolier at each Lorien Trust Main Event with tools and materials obtained and used in the relevant Guild area. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. This skill allows you to reduce the time required for checking that retrieved or returned projectiles are safe to use again (see Projectile Weapons Use description). A Bowyer (Apprentice) may check up to 6 projectiles per min (10 Seconds per projectile). In addition this skill allows you to Mend a Shattered Bow or crossbow with 1 min of appropriate roleplay, this ability does not require any power and may not be used to Mend any other item.
