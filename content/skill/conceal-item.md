With this skill a character can conceal a single item about their person. The item must be fully hidden in the character’s clothing or kit to count as concealed. This item cannot then be found by searching unless the [Locate][locate] Occupational Skill is used. This item cannot be larger than a small melee weapon. Items will remain concealed even after character death. To use your conceal item skill you must obtain a conceal lammie from Game Control, this will have your Character name and Player ID written on it before the lammie is sealed. To conceal an item requires concentration and will take 10 seconds – once the item is concealed, concentration is not required. You should attach your conceal lammie to the item and hide it within your character kit. When a concealed item is removed from its hidden place (by choice or through searching) the conceal lammie should be removed and retained to either re-attach using the rules above or for concealing a different item. NOTE: If you have an item that is concealed that is Magical (has a PR Rating) if Detect Magic is cast on you the Detect Magic will work but will not allow the item to be found.
