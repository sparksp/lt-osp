This skill requires the presence of a marshal or referee and will often be restricted to particular situations, locations or opportunities. This skill allows a character to look for clues, tracks and tell-tale signs of other creatures when they first visit an area (usually in wooded or rural areas). The character will gain a rough idea as to the type of creatures in that area (Orc, Human, Elven etc.) from length of stride, weight and markings of footprints, the way foliage has been disturbed or other such information. It may also be possible to determine approximate numbers of the creatures, direction of travel etc. (depending on weather conditions, time of day and other factors). The character using Tracking must role-play checking the area for a minimum of 30 seconds (more roleplay may get greater information). Once per hour a character with the Tracking skill can use their tracking skill to sense creatures nearby. The character must remain immobile (should stay comfortably still and not move, cast spells, or perform any other in-character actions including parrying/striking blows etc.) and remain silent for 1 min – after this time has elapsed the character may use the vocals “Detect \<Race> 30 feet” (\<Race> being any of the starting character races available during character creation highlighted in **Bold**). This detection ability may only be used after dusk (8pm).
