This skill replaces [Discern Race]({{< ref "discern-race" >}}). After 10 seconds concentration on a single target within 30 feet (~9m), the character may make the call "Discern Race and Pattern" or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. The target will not be aware in-character that they have been discerned. The discern will give the race on the target's character card and if their pattern state is Living, Unliving or Magical. **This does not allow the detection of Alien or Aberrant patterns.**
