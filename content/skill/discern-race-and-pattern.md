This skill replaces [Discern Race]({{< ref "discern-race" >}}). After 10 seconds concentration on a single target within 30 feet (~9m), the character may make the call “discern race and pattern” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. The target will not be aware in-character that they have been discerned. The discern will give the race on the target's character card and if their pattern state is Living, Unliving or Magical.
