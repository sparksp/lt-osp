This skill will replace the [Scholar \<X> OS][scholar-x] (where \<X> is the same subject). If a character with this skill submits research requests on the specified topic, \<X>, then they will receive answers in accordance with their further enhanced ability in research related to that topic. Suggestions for available topics can be obtained from Game Control. Allows the submission (subject to the relevant IC arrangements) of a research request during the summer research period (subject to an overall maximum limit of one research submission per character per research period). This skill may only be purchased once and to attempt to learn it you must submit a research request. While this skill primarily assists with research, it may grant additional information at a referee's discretion, but it cannot replicate a character skill, or occupational skill.
