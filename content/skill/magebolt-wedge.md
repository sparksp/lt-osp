The character may enter a wedge with other Warlocks, and the head of the wedge may use 4 spell cards from the wedge to cast the Magebolt spell. Excess cards are wasted. The head of the wedge must have this OS, all members must be able to cast Blast and the wedge must be at least two characters. This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.
