A character with this skill can identify the approximate powers or purpose of a magical lammed item - these may include structures, standing stones or other unusual items. The examination of the item requires a minimum 1 minute of appropriate role-play with a Referee or Marshall present and will not always produce a result. _Loresheets_ for this skill are available for download and print from The Lorien Trust Website.

Once per day a character with the Diagnose Powers skill may examine a Special item that has fully exhausted its required Item Cards for the day or event. After 10 minutes of holding the item and roleplayed examination, the character may restore a single item card to the Special item – this is achieved by taking the item to Game Control, handing over the Diagnosed item, state that you are using your skill to restore a single item card for the item – after your details and the item details have been checked, a single item card will be re-issued for that day for the Diagnosed item.
