This skill replaces and includes the occupational skill [Arcane Crafter (Apprentice)][arcane-crafter-apprentice]. At each Lorien Trust Main Event the character may produce up to 2x Level 1 and 2x Level 2 Crafted Arcane Items. For many of the crafted items the Arcane Crafter must be able to cast the desired spell to Craft the Item (i.e. to produce an Amulet of Spell Reduction (1) for the Spell Blast â€“ the Crafter must be able to cast the spell Blast). The in-game cost for the materials will vary from time to time and list can be obtained from the Arcane Guilds.
