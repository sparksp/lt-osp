Each level of this skill requires and replaces the previous level. The character may create an innate Mass Fear effect once a day per level of the Occupational Skill (Item cards or Power req.), which cannot be countered. **The vocals are “innate mass fear”**. Mass Fear may not be used on large groups or in mass combat without consulting a Referee or Marshal for safety reasons. This skill can only be used or purchased if the character has an applicable lammie or loresheet that allows it.

Note: this is an effect and not a spell, and may not be combined with Spell Reduction.
