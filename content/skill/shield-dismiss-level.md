If a Discern \<X> of the correct type is used on the character then they may respond "\<X>, discern shielded". If the discerning character spends a further 10 seconds discerning the character and a second Discern Vocal is used the attempt will be successful. A character that is discerned will immediately feel a tingle of magic and be aware that they have been the target of a discern attempt (the referee or marshal will identify the character or source of the discern). If the target of the discern attempt gets further than 30 feet away before the further 10 seconds of discerning is completed then the process is disrupted and must be started anew.
