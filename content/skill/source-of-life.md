This skill replaces the [Advanced Healing][advanced-healing] Occupational Skill, and includes the [Mind Healing][mind-healing] Occupational Skill. It also allows the character to cast the Total Heal Spell without having the requirement of the [High Magic][high-magic] Occupational Skill. If the character gains the [High Magic (Healing)][high-magic-healing] Occupational Skill, they gain Spell Reduction (3) for the spell Total Heal.
