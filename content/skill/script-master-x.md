This skill replaces the [TNS]({{< ref "translate-named-script-x" >}} "Translate Named Script") from the family of TNS skills it belongs to and allows a character to collect all of the loresheets for each of the TNS Scripts within that chosen Script Category (Regional and Historical, People and Race or Myth and Magic). This skill also allows the character to translate all of the named scripts in this category to common.
