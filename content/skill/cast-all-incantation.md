This skill replaces the [Cast Additional Incantation]({{< ref "cast-additional-incantation" >}}) Occupational Skill. The character gains the ability to cast spells from the Cast All Incantation list (instead of the normal Incantation list). This skill counts as a prerequisite for [Elementalism]({{< ref "elementalism" >}}) or [Necromancy]({{< ref "necromancy" >}}) (one or the other - may not have both skills at the same time).
