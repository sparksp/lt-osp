The character may create an innate Mass Fear effect using 4 of their own spell cards. This counts in all way as a level 3 mass spell and cannot be countered. The vocals are “*innate mass fear”*. Mass Fear may not be used on large groups or in mass combat without consulting a Referee or Marshal for safety reasons.
