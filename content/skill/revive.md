This skill allows a character to extend a Chant of Heal Wound to every location on a single character, for no additional Spell Power. The healing is location by location, not simultaneous and the healer may choose what damage to heal first. Proximity distance with any part of the target is sufficient but the Chant of Heal Wound cannot heal any location with a mortal wound, these must be healed separately. The spell functions in all other ways as normal. In addition the character may expend one power and concentrate on a target within proximity distance, after 10 seconds they may remove a non-venom debilitation effect.
