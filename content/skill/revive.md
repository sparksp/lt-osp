This skill allows a character to extend a Chant of Heal Wounds to every location on a single character, for no additional Spell Power. The healing is location by location, not simultaneous and the healer may choose what damage to heal first. Contact with any part of the target is sufficient but the Chant of Heal Wounds cannot heal any location with a mortal wound, these must be healed separately. The spell functions in all other ways as normal.
